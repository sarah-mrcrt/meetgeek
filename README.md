## Context
In our second year of DUT Information and Communication Technologies, we had to do a tiny Facebook from November to December 2019.
The goal was to create a PHP and SQL project from scratch to introduce us to back-end development while discovering web integration.

## Functionalities
Each user can :
- add, accept and delete friends
- search for other users
- publish and delete written or pictured posts on your and your friends' walls
- follow the news of his friends

## Getting Started

Modify the ***bd.php*** file in the ***config*** folder

```
$host = "Server";
$db = "Database name";
$user = "User name";
$passwd = "User password";
```

Open [http://localhost/meetgeek](http://localhost/meetgeek) to view it in the browser.
